# Hungry Hungry Santa

The holidays are a time when people gather together, rejoice and make memories. Sharing a meal, laughter and dessert with your favorite people in the world is one of the most fulfilling experiences and food is ultimately what helps bring people together. Unfortunately due to the pandemic, getting your favorite foods while staying safe and socially distanced is challenging. This sucks for the two of us as we are really big Foodies.

Therefore, we built this platform to help people physically distance, get the food they enjoy, and help local restaurants. We hope this app helps keep people safe during the holiday season and maybe even motivates people to explore new places to eat and support small businesses.
